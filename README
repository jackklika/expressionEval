This is a program which prompts the user for a text file containing mathmatical expressions seperated by line breaks.

Version 0.1 of this program has the following capabilities:

- Evaluating expressions containing the following:
    - Numbers >= 0 and <= 9
    - Operands +, -, *, /, <, and >
        - > and < will return the maximum of the two operands or the minimum of the two operands respectively
    - Parentheses
- Expressions will be evaluated with integer arithmatic

The program will return the equations and their results.
    For example, if given a text file containing "2+2", it would return "2+2 == 4"

WARNINGS:
    This is a program created by an 18 year old still learning how to program. If you really need an expression evaluator for a serious project, please look somewhere else. This is simply a proof of concept and means for me to practice learning how to use stacks in Java.
    Errors are NOT handled gracefully whatsoever. Use at your own risk!
